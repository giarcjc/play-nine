## How To Play
A random number of stars will appear, along with an array of numbers from 1-9.  You must pick combinations of numbers from the bottom array that will add up to the number of stars.  Numbers you select will appear on the right.  When you have made your selection, click the `=` button to see if it's correct or not. Each time you select a number it becomes unavailable for future use.  Click the `refresh` button to generate a new array of stars.  If you make a mistack and want to remove a number choice from the right-hand side, simply click on that number.
